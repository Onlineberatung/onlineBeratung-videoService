# Online-Beratung VideoService

The VideoService handles the creation of JSON web tokens to authorize users for a (Jitsi) videocall via the VideoBackend. These tokens contain the username for registered users and moderators, the URL to join the call, the validity period of the token as well as a guest link URL for moderators with which anonymous users can join the call.
Furthermore it handles the notifications of an incoming call and provides an action to reject incoming calls.
